Practice for Samsung developers
It is proposed to load a video file from a local folder on the PC and play it using the options allowed by the Media Source API.

The development must include the following indications:

A button panel will be placed at the bottom of the video that allows you to start and stop the playback as well as raise and lower the volume.
You will need to handle errors so that files that are not of the correct type cannot be loaded.
While the video is being loaded, a warning message must be displayed to the user indicating this, since the operation may take a few minutes.
